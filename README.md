## My DISMATH weekly portfolio 

# **Week 1**
- I was introduced to a new subject called **Discrete Mathematics** or *DISMATH*

# **Week 2**

- I learned about logical connectives. The logical connectives are shown in the table below.

| Operator | Symbol | Usage | Java/C++ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Negation | ¬ | not | !
| Conjunction | ∧ | and | &&
| Disjunction | v | or | \|\|
| Exclusive-or | ⊕ | xor | (p\|\|q&&!p\|\|!q)
| Conditional | → | if,then | p?q:true
| Biconditional | ↔ | if & only if, iff | (p&&q)\|\|(!p&&!q)

- I learned about mathematical proofs, propositional statements, logical deductions and axioms.
- I learned about propositional variables.
- I also learned about truth tables. The truth table for conjuction is shown below.

| P | Q | P∧Q |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| T | T | **T** |
| T | F | **F** |
| F | T | **F** |
| F | F | **F** |

- I learned about propositional logic. These are: *Converse logic*, *Inverse logic*, and *Contrapositive logic*.
- I learned about logical equivalences. These equivalences are listed below.

| Name | Logical Equivalence |
| :---: | :---: |
| Identity Laws |  |
| Domination Laws |  |
| Negation Laws |  |
| Double Negation Law |  |
| Idempotent Laws |  |
| Commutative Laws | p ∧ q = q ∧ p p ∨ q|
| Associative Laws |  |
| Distributive Laws |  |
| De Morgan's Laws |  |
| Absorption Laws |  |
