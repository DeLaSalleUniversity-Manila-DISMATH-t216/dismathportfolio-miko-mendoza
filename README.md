## My DISMATH weekly portfolio 

# **Week 1**

- I was introduced to a new subject called **Discrete Mathematics** or *DISMATH*

# **Week 2**

- I learned about logical connectives. The logical connectives are shown in the table below.

| Operator | Symbol | Usage | Java/C++ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Negation | ¬ | not | !
| Conjunction | ∧ | and | &&
| Disjunction | v | or | \|\|
| Exclusive-or | ⊕ | xor | (p\|\|q&&!p\|\|!q)
| Conditional | → | if,then | p?q:true
| Biconditional | ↔ | if & only if, iff | (p&&q)\|\|(!p&&!q)

- I learned about mathematical proofs, propositional statements, logical deductions and axioms.
- I learned about propositional variables.
- I also learned about truth tables. The truth table for conjuction is shown below.

| P | Q | P∧Q |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| T | T | **T** |
| T | F | **F** |
| F | T | **F** |
| F | F | **F** |

- I learned about propositional logic. These are: *Converse logic*, *Inverse logic*, and *Contrapositive logic*.
- I learned about logical equivalences.
- I also learned that Superman does not logically exist.

# **Week 2**

- I was introduced to a new logic called **Predicate Logic**
- I learned about quantifiers. 
  * **Existential Quantifier** (∃x) - "There exist" is true iff P(x) is true for at least one value in the x domain.
  * **Universal Quantifier** (∀x) - "For all" states that a predicate is true for any value in a particular domain.
- I also learned about terminologies for **Rules of Inference**
  * **Argument** - A sequence of statements that end with a conclusion (p<sub>1</sub>∧p<sub>2</sub>∧p<sub>3</sub>∧...∧p<sub>n</sub>) → q
  * **Valid** - The conclusion, or final statement of the argument, must follow from the truthe of the preceding statements, or premises, of the argument.
  * **Fallacy** - Common form of an incorrect reasoning that leads to an invalid argument.
  * **Tautology** - Statement that is always *TRUE*.

# **Week 3**

- I learned about the rules of inference

| Rule of Inference | Tautology | Name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| p<br>p→q<br>____<br>∴ q | (p∧(p→q))→q | Modus Ponens |
